Structuur Polymer Report

Introduction
	• (possible) reason for studying polymers
	• overview of model used and assumptions made
	• 	

Model
	• dilute polymer solution
	• -> effective repulsion of polymer segments
	• mesoscopic model of polymer: chain of beads
		• long distance attraction (Van der Waals)				|-> Lennard-Jones interaction
		• short range repulsion (overlap and solvent effect)	|
		• neighbouring segments have fixed mutual distance

Algorithm
	• Rosenbluth Algorithm
		• initial configuration
		• adding beads (weights, angles, ...)
		• total weight factor of a polymor (because the R.A. has bias towards dense configurations, which is a trade-off of solving atrition)
	• Pruning and Enriching (PERM)
		• Cloning and killing procedure
		• Choosing UpLim and LowLim

Simulation and results
	• Setup (how many polymers, other parameters, )

	• End to end distance
	• Gyradius
