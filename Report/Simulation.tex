\subsection*{Simulation}
In the simulation 10000 polymers were grown for the RR method and 5000 polymers were grown for the algorithm including PERM. Each polymer bead has a reduced fixed length of 1.0 with respect to the previous bead. The acting Lennard-Jones potential uses reduced units of $\epsilon=0.25$ and $\sigma=0.8$, also the reduced temperature is set to $T=1.0$. All the polymers are grown to a length of $N=350$. 

We are interested in the average End-to-end-distance $R$ as a function of polymer length $N$ and in the average Gyradius as a function of length $N$. The average End-to-end-distance $R$ will be compared to the theoretical result, according to which it should relate to $N$ as $R\propto N^{3/4}$.

The limits for pruning and enriching are determined and dynamically updated according to the average weight of each polymer for each length $N$. Values of $\alpha_-=1.2$ and $\alpha_+=2.0$ are used for updating the upper and lower limit according to \eqref{eq:LowLim_UpLim}. This choice of upper and lower limit ensures the population of polymers remains fairly constant. A comparison is made of the results between the standard Rosenbluth algorithm and the PERM algorithm.
