In this report two algorithms were discussed for Monte Carlo simulations of 2D polymers. The first algorithm is based on Rosenbluth's method of adding one bead after another, while favouring low energy confirmations and implementing a self avoiding interaction. It was found that the pruning and enriching significantly decreased the variance of the calculated observables and made is possible to produce polymers of up to 350 beads long.
