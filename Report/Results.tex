\subsubsection*{Average End-to-end distance $R$}

In Figure \ref{fig:etoe} the square of the average End-to-end distance $R^2$ is plotted on a log-log scale.

It is seen that the results for $N>100$ are a lot better if PERM is being implemented. This is expected because the longer the polymer becomes the higher the probability that it traps itself. If PERM is being implemented a polymer can't go on after trapping itself and the values are $R^2$ agree with the theoretical value again. 


\subsubsection*{Average Gyradius $G$}

In Figure \ref{fig:gyradius} the average Gyaradius $G$ is plotted on a log-log scale.
