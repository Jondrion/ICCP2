In this report the simulation and results of a dilute polymer solution is described.  A Monte Carlo simulation in 2D-space is performed to grow polymers segment by segment. The segments only interact with each other through the Lennard-Jones Potential. A Rosenbluth like algorithm is applied to add new segments, favouring lowest energy configurations. To achieve more reliable results a Pruning and Enrichments technique is applied, which promotes lower energy configurations and kills higher energy configurations. The simulation is used to calculate polymer properties in 2D like End-to-end distance and Gyradius. A total of 10000 polymers are grown to a length of 350 segments.
